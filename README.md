# NE-flappybird

This project is an implementation of neuro-evolution techniques using pytorch to make an AI agent that is able to play Flappybird in "human" level or better.

This project was done entirely for fun, and was included in a seminar talk I presented on the topic of evolution and games: [link to the presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-3R-Rxr_p3sAPNx1vfStFdQUYGagXds/view?usp=sharing).

All the GIFs and images are taken from the presentation.




## Replay of selected generetions during evolution
  Generetion 2 |  Generetion 5 | Generetion 67  |  Generetion 88 - replay speed x2|
